function S=jpattern_num(H0, M, dxi, zeta, L, N, threshold)
%JPattern_NUM   Computes the sparsity pattern of the Jacobian matrix numerically.
%
%   S = jpattern_num(H0, M, dxi, zeta, L, N)
%
%   This function determines the sparsity pattern of the Jacobian matrix
%   corresponding to the system of evolution equations defined in the function
%   `Equations`. The Jacobian is approximated using finite differences via MATLABâ€™s
%   `numjac` function, which is useful for implicit ODE solvers that benefit from
%   sparsity exploitation (e.g., ode15s).
%
%   Outputs:
%       S     - Sparse binary matrix representing the Jacobian structure (nonzero pattern)
%
%   The Jacobian is computed numerically by perturbing each variable and observing the
%   change in the time derivative produced by the `Equations` function.
%   Only the structure (pattern of nonzero entries) is retained in the output.
%
%   Note:
%       - This function assumes that the `Equations` function returns a dense Jacobian
%         when perturbed, which is then sparsified using `spones`.
%       - `vectorized='on'` indicates that `Equations` can handle vectorized inputs.
%
% Example usage:
%   S = jpattern_num(H0, M, dxi, zeta, L, N);
%   opts.JPattern = S;  % Used in ODE solver options for efficiency
